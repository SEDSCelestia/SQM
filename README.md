# Sky-Quality-Meter
This is a device which measures sky quality over a region. We use a 16-bit LCD shield and an arduino along with some jumper cables & a small lens. We used a TSL 235R Light to frequence sensor
The electronics components are easy to procure online, lens can be obtained easily from an optics shop.
The frequence output by the sensor is converted to magnitude.
A good sky means a magnitude of 14 or more & a bad one is 7 and below.
